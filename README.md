# drivers_health_certificate
Make a graph for each driver of HR and blood pressure readings by examination over a period of time, in order. Also note on the graphs when the driver's limits (health) were changed. In this way we want to check how the certificates (medicine) affect the drivers' health indicators. This report is planned to be provided to client companies on a regular basis, so that they in turn regulate driver health in some way. It is also possible to perform additional analytics on how the change of boundaries affected the drivers' health indicators (visualization, etc.).
